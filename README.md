# NYC Ciitibike Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
Analyzing data from Citibike bike-sharing program in New York City area, provide the visualization of bike trip data to convince investors about launching a bike-sharing program in Des Moines. In order to do so, we will make following visualizations:  

1. Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
2. Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
3. Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

Lastly, we combine these visualizations into Tableau dashboards and stories as final presentations for investors.

1. **Gender Breakdown**

2. **Checkout Times by Gender**
- The line diagram is displaying three different lines by gender. Although, the line for male is significantly bigger in terms of 'Number of Bikes,' the shape of lines are almost identical between male and female, which means both male and female tend to have similar characterstics in checkout times. Therefore, we do not see much reason to prefer certain gender over the other for checkout time.
